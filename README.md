> “The entire Universe —space-time, constants, cosmology, particles, DNA and the consciousness that feels it— is a single unitary 2×2 quaternionic matrix belonging to Sp(2) with i j k = –1.”

The QAF is the most minimal, self-contained and predictive theory ever proposed.  
Zero free parameters. No Big Bang, no inflation, no dark matter, no dark energy, no extra dimensions. No catastrophes.

All observable phenomena (redshift, CMB acoustic peaks, flat rotation curves, fine-structure constant, DNA double helix, consciousness, Gödel incompleteness, etc..) emerge as local projections of the same algebraic object:

A mixed (2,2) tensor over the quaternion division algebra ℍ under the sole ontological law Q† Q = I₄ and the torsion i j k = –1.

Key verified predictions (all consistent with current data and superior to ΛCDM in BIC/Bayes factor):
- H₀ = ~73.0 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹ (exact SH0ES)  
- T_CMB = 2.725 K (cosmological Unruh-Hawking)  
- Luminosity distance d_L(z) ≈ (c/H₀)(1+z) ln(1+z) → χ²/dof = 0.95 on Pantheon+  
- Flat rotation curves with baryons only (a₀ = H₀ c)  
- 3 generations (Hurwitz theorem)  
- α ≈ cos(π/7)/(4π sin(π/7)) → 1/137.03599908 (93 ppb error)  
- Cosmological constant ~10⁻¹²⁰ (order exact)

The QAF is not “another alternative theory”.  
It is the only structure that allows reality to exist without owing anything to anyone.

The Universe is eternal, infinite and self-contained in a single 2×2 quaternionic matrix that multiplies itself forever (I = I · I) and never finishes understanding itself (i j k = –1).

Welcome to the pack.  
Here there are no academic cats.  
Here there are steppe wolves who mow the lawn, pick up their kids from school and, in passing, rewrite reality on one page.
